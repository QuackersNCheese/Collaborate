    <h2>Try contributing for first time</h2>
    <p>Contributing to open source projects is a great way to learn new skills and gain experience. It also allows you to give back to the community and help improve the software that you use. If you are new to open source, here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find a project that interests you: Look for projects that you are passionate about and that you would like to contribute to. This will make the process more enjoyable and rewarding.</li>
      <li>Read the contribution guidelines: Before you start contributing, make sure to read the project's contribution guidelines. This will help you understand how to contribute effectively and follow the project's coding standards.</li>
      <li>Start small: If you are new to open source, it's a good idea to start with small contributions. This will help you get familiar with the project and the community, and build your confidence.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My First Branch</h2>
    <p>Branch is a part of the code that is isolated from the main code. It is used to develop new features without affecting the main code. Once the feature is developed, it can be merged with the main code.</p>
    <p>Branching is a very useful feature of version control systems like Git. It allows developers to work on different features in isolation. It also allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's work.</p>

    <h2>A <strong>fork</strong> and a <strong>clone</strong> are related but serve different purposes in Git:</h2>
    <h3>Fork</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A fork is a copy of a repository that is created on a remote platform like GitHub under your account.</li>
      <li>It is typically used when you want to contribute to someone else's project. You fork their repository to your GitHub account, make changes, and then submit a pull request to propose your changes.</li>
      <li>A fork is independent of the original repository, but you can sync it with the upstream repository to pull in updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Clone</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A clone is a local copy of a repository (either your own or someone else's) on your machine.</li>
      <li>It is created using the git clone command and allows you to work on the repository locally.</li>
      <li>A clone is directly tied to the remote repository it was cloned from (e.g., for pushing and pulling changes).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collaborating with Others</h2>
    <p>Collaborating with others on a project is a great way to learn from each other, share ideas, and build something together. Here are some tips for collaborating effectively:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Communicate: Make sure to communicate clearly with your collaborators. This includes discussing the goals of the project, assigning tasks, and providing feedback.</li>
      <li>Use version control: Version control systems like Git allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's work. Make sure to use branches to develop new features and merge them back into the main codebase when they are ready.</li>
      <li>Be open to feedback: Be open to receiving feedback from your collaborators and be willing to provide feedback in return. This will help improve the quality of the project and foster a positive working relationship.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

    <h2>Branching</h2>
    <p>Branching is a way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default, your repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.</p>
    <p>When you create a branch off the main branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.</p>

        <h2>Creating a Pull Request</h2>
        <p>A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository on GitHub. It allows you to submit your changes to the project maintainer and request that they be merged into the main codebase. Here are the steps to create a pull request:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Fork the repository: If you haven't already, fork the repository on GitHub to create a copy under your account.</li>
        <li>Create a branch: Create a new branch on your forked repository to make your changes. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase.</li>
        <li>Make your changes: Make the changes you want to propose to the project. This can include adding new features, fixing bugs, or updating documentation.</li>
        <li>Commit your changes: Once you are happy with your changes, commit them to your branch. Make sure to write clear and descriptive commit messages.</li>
        <li>Create a pull request: Go to the original repository on GitHub and click on the "New pull request" button. Select your branch and the branch you want to merge your changes into.</li>
        <li>Review your changes: Review your changes and provide a description of what you did. This will help the project maintainer understand your proposed changes.</li>
        <li>Submit your pull request: Once you are ready, submit your pull request. The project maintainer will review your changes and decide whether to merge them into the main codebase.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Code Review</h2>
        <p>Code review is a process in which developers review each other's code to find bugs, improve code quality, and ensure that the code meets the project's standards. It is an essential part of the software development process and helps maintain code quality and consistency.</p>
        <p>Code reviews can be done in person or using code review tools like GitHub's pull request feature. Here are some best practices for code reviews:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Be kind and respectful: Remember that code reviews are about improving the code, not criticizing the developer. Be kind and respectful in your comments and focus on the code, not the person.</li>
        <li>Focus on the code, not the author: When reviewing code, focus on the code itself and how it can be improved. Avoid personal attacks or making assumptions about the author's intentions.</li>
        <li>Provide constructive feedback: When providing feedback, be specific and constructive. Point out areas for improvement and suggest ways to address them. Avoid vague or unhelpful comments.</li>
        <li>Set clear expectations: Make sure the author knows what you are looking for in the code review. This can include coding standards, performance requirements, or other project-specific guidelines.</li>
        <li>Be open to feedback: Be open to receiving feedback on your own code and be willing to make changes based on the feedback you receive. Code reviews are a two-way street, and everyone can benefit from constructive criticism.</li>
        </ol>
